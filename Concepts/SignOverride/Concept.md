# Sign Overrides

The whole point in this concept is for keeping your signs text the same. That way players cannot mess up the color with their html crap.

#### Keeping your color
`Canvas_Override_Color <color>`
The color can be a hex.

#### Keeping your bold

`Canvas_Override_Bold`
Keeps the text as bold no matter what.
