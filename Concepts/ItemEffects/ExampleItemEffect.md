# UnturnedItemEffect Concept

Imagine an awesome effect playing when you first obtain a superpowered sword! This is what we are going for. Item.dat files should be able to list an effect that will be played when obtaining an item.

`Obtain_Effect <id>`

^ this will go into the items .dat file.

Incase you would like to add a direct path to the effect/audioclip needed:

`Obtain_Effect_Path <path>`
