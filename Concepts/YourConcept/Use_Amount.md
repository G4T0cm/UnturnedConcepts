# Use_Amount Concept


Currently it is possible to add a quantity to certain items, even if they have no use like medical items, 
so with `use_Amount <cuantity>` that count will be changued, giving the possibility of making an item that has several uses


Example:

`Amount 10`<br>
`Count_Min 0`<br>
`Count_Max 10`<br>
`Use_Amount 1`<br>
<br>
In this case, an item with 10 uses, when used it would be left with 9 uses
