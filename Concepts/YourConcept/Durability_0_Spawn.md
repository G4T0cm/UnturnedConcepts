# Durability_0_Spawn  & Durability_0_Spawntable

This concept can be usefull for more survival aspect of tools, guns, items etc when the durability drops to 0 the item dissapears and gives you the one that is indicated.

`Durability_0_Spawn <id>`

^ this will go into the items .dat file.

Incase you would like to add the spawntable:

`Durability_0_Spawntable >id>`

This can be usefull to create a random item that will drop (For example some machine pieces)
