# UnturnedConcepts

Welcome to Unturned Concepts! We are focused on creating new useful concepts for modders. Which will hopefully enter the game someday.

We are accepting concepts from team members and from people outside the community. Feel free to suggest any edits to our concepts.

### Want to join the team?

Feel free to friend me at Jdance#4840 over on discord. If you have some great concepts to share with us all.

If you happen to not be interested in being part of the team you can still add files and I'll accept them into the respository.

### Like what you see?

Give us feedback and suggestions by creating an issue on the respository.
